# Talks

Some of the more well prepared talks I have given.

I use [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) (a jupyter extension) for the presentations.

See how to install it there.
Or you can look at them with [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org), links to do so should be at the top of each presentation.


All of these talks are released under the MIT License.
