# Talks

Some of the more well prepared talks I have given.

I use [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) (a jupyter extension) for the presentations.

View them statically nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lutostag/talks/tree/master/), links should also be at the top of each presentation.

To have interactive sessions you can use the [interactive link from mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lutostag/talks/master)

## Local Install
If you have docker installed, you can get the exact versions I use with the [jupyter repo2docker tool](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io)
To install and run simply:
```console
$ python3 -m pip install jupyter-repo2docker
$ jupyter repo2docker .
```

## License
All of these talks are released under the MIT License.
